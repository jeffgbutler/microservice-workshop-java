# Setup

The following instructions will help you install a Java development environment from scratch. If you already have a Java/Maven/Git environment installed that you are familiar with, then you can simply clone the repository and work in your existing environment.

Note: If you experience difficulties building the projects after following these instructions, see the Maven Notes section at the bottom of this page.

## For all Environments
Install and configure Java and Git. Some of these steps are optional depending on the IDE you choose and your preferred workflow. If you have experience with these tools then you may feel free to alter the instructions to fit your preferences. If you plan to use Visual Studio Code, then your life will be easier if you use a setup similar to what's shown here.

### Download/Install 
1. Install JDK 8 or higher from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
1. Install Git from https://git-scm.com/

### Configure
If you are using VS Code, your life will be easier if you set the JAVA_HOME environment variable. There are a variety of ways to do this. If you are on Windows, then the easiest way to do this is to use the control panel applet to edit environment variables. We suggest you make these changes to the "user" environment variables and not the "system" environment variables.

| Environment Variable | Setting |
|----------------------|---------|
| JAVA_HOME| Set to the home directory of your JDK installation (for example, \Program Files\Java\jdk-10.0.1) |

## Setup for Eclipse
1. Install Eclipse from http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/ - for these exercises the "Eclipse IDE for Java Developers" package is sufficient. If you plan on using Eclipse for web development in the future, then we recommend installing the "Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers" package
1. Clone the repository from https://github.com/jeffgbutler/microservice-workshop-java.git, or download the zip from https://github.com/jeffgbutler/microservice-workshop-java/archive/master.zip
1. Open Eclipse, make a new workspace
1. Import 4 projects from the "/exercises" directory in the cloned code repo (File->Import...->Existing Maven Project)
1. Start the web service in the `movie-award-service` project by navigating to `microservice.workshop.movieawardservice.MovieAwardServiceApplication.java` and running the class as a Java application
1. Once the web service starts, open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:8083. You should see the Swagger UI for this web service. You can run a few queries to return some sample data (ids from 1 to 20 will return data)
1. After you have shown that the service works, terminate the program
 
## Setup for IntelliJ
1. Install IntelliJ Community Edition from https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download
1. Clone the repository from https://github.com/jeffgbutler/microservice-workshop-java.git, or download the zip from https://github.com/jeffgbutler/microservice-workshop-java/archive/master.zip
1. Open IntelliJ, make a new empty project
1. Import 4 Maven projects from the "/exercises" directory in the cloned repo (File->New->Module From Existing Sources...)
1. Start the web service in the `movie-award-service` project by navigating to `microservice.workshop.movieawardservice.MovieAwardServiceApplication.java` and running the main method in the class
1. Once the web service starts, open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:8083. You should see the Swagger UI for this web service. You can run a few queries to return some sample data (ids from 1 to 20 will return data)
1. After you have shown that the service works, terminate the program

## Setup for Visual Studio Code
1. Install VS code from https://code.visualstudio.com/
1. Clone the repository from https://github.com/jeffgbutler/microservice-workshop-java.git, or download the zip from https://github.com/jeffgbutler/microservice-workshop-java/archive/master.zip
1. Open VS code in the cloned code repo:
   - cd ...\microservice-workshop-java\exercises
   - code .
1. Open the extensions page (ctrl-shift-X), install the Java Extension Pack (from Microsoft)
1. If you get the message from VS Code that it can't find the Java Runtime...
   - ctrl-shift-P (show all commands)
   - Open Workplace settings
   - Add setting "java.home": "\<your JDK location\>" (for example "C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Java\\\\jdk-10.0.1")
   - Reload the window (ctrl-shift-P, then "Reload Window")
1. Open a terminal window at the `movie-award-wervice` folder (right click on the folder, then "Open In Terminal")
1. Start the web service with Maven:
    - (Linux/Mac) ./mvnw clean spring-boot:run
    - (Windows) mvnw clean spring-boor:run
1. Once the web service starts, open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:8083. You should see the Swagger UI for this web service. You can run a few queries to return some sample data (ids from 1 to 20 will return data)
1. After you have shown that the service works, you can end the service by pressing ctrl-c in the terminal window

## Maven Notes
If you experience difficulties in building the project, it might be that your workstation is configured to communicate with an internal Maven repository that cannot be reached when you are off-site. If this is true in your case, you can temporarily disable your connection to the internal Maven repository by renaming your Maven `settings.xml` file:

1. (Windows) Navigate to `\Users\<your id>\.m2`
2. (Linux/Mac) Navigate to `~\.m2`
3. Rename `settings.xml` to `settings.xml.save`

**Important** Remember to rename the file back to `settings.xml` once you are finished with this workshop.
